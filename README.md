# ForTeamlab

This repository is for teamlab jobhunting.

It contains four models, GAN, DCGAN, WGAN and CycleGAN.

These models are built for testing my thesis and will be applied into it after some changes.

Due to their testing purpose, they are now testing on MINST or horse2zebra dataset

And the targets of these models currently are:

1. GAN, DCGAN and WGAN are testing in MINST, to create realistic digital number.

2. CyGAN model is testing in horse2zebra dataset, and the purpose is to convert horses into zebras, and vice versa.
